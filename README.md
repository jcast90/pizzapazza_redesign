#pizzapazza_redesign
website redesign 

This is a class project where we took a poorly designed website and rebuilt it. The website we chose was pizzapazzafoodtruck.com, it is a local San Diegan food truck with a poorly designed website.
All their code is outdated and the site is inconsistent. The goal was to create a visually appealing website and increase traffic.
